# Regex Data Extraction Tool

Hey! This is my regex data extraction project for the ALU assignment. It finds different types of data in text like emails, phone numbers, URLs and more!

## What This Project Does

This tool takes any text and finds important information in it using regex patterns. It can find:

- Email addresses (like user@example.com)
- Website URLs (like https://www.example.com)
- Phone numbers (different formats like (123) 456-7890)
- Credit card numbers
- Time formats (both 12-hour and 24-hour)
- HTML tags
- Hashtags (like #coding)
- Currency amounts (like $19.99)

## Why I Made This

As a junior developer, I wanted to practice regex and build something useful. This project helps extract data from messy text which is super useful for web scraping and data processing!
